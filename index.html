                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>The night before serving, stir the cinnamon and 100ml water (or milk) into your oats with a pinch of
                    salt.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>The next day, loosen with a little more water (or milk) if needed. Top with the yogurt, berries, a
                    drizzle of honey and the nut butter.</p>

        <h3>What are overnight oats?</h3>
        <p>Overnight oats are basically oats which have been left to soak overnight in milk or water, rather than being
            cooked in the morning. This no-cook method allows the oats to absorb the liquid overnight and soften them so
            that they are ready to eat in the morning. This makes overnight oats a quick and easy breakfast option, and
            you can easily customise them with different toppings and sauces.
